# BlackBox

## What is BlackBox
Black box is designed to run on a small screen next to a window with a view of the sky. The screen indicates where in the sky to view the nearest airplane plus details on the flight such as speed, range, altitude, vertical rate and flight number if available.

## BlackBox API (this repo)
BlackBox API queries a Mode S decoder endpoint like Dump1090 attached to a SDR (software defined radio) and returns the airplanes within the view area in addtion to the direction to look in the sky and range from the origin point.

## BlackBox UI (this repo)
in development
